# Vero Córdoba Spa Website

This website was developed during my internship at **Virtud Inc.** as a real client project for **Vero Córdoba Spa**, a beauty and aesthetics clinic. I contributed to the **frontend design, development, and deployment** of the site, helping create a modern, responsive online presence that converts visitors into appointments.

- Multi-page layout: Home, Treatments, About Me, Contact  
- Lead-capturing contact form with email notifications  
- Sticky call-to-action buttons for easy booking  
- Services section with expandable treatment details  
- SEO-friendly structure for better search visibility  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Next.js** – React-based framework for modern web apps  
- **TypeScript** – Strongly typed JavaScript for reliability  
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first CSS framework for styling  
- **Vercel** – Hosting and deployment platform  

## 📌 My Contributions
